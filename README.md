# Analysis of Graph Algorithms 

Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of two widely used Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms: Kruskal's Algorithm and Prim's Algorithm. A Minimum Spanning Tree is a tree that spans all the vertices in a connected, undirected graph while minimizing the total edge weight. These algorithms are useful in various applications such as network design, circuit design, and clustering.

Kruskal's Algorithm\n
Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a connected, weighted graph. It does this by iteratively adding the smallest edge that does not form a cycle with the edges already included in the spanning tree.

Prim's Algorithm\n
Prim's Algorithm is another greedy algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree for a weighted, connected graph. It starts with an arbitrary node and grows the spanning tree by adding the smallest edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.
